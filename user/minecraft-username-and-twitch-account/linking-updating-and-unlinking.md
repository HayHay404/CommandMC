# Linking, Updating & Unlinking

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only "online" (or official) Minecraft accounts will be supported. The bot will not allow you to link non-official accounts.
{% endhint %}

### Linking your Minecraft username

To link your Minecraft account to your Twitch account, simply type `!link <username>` in any Twitch chat where this bot has been added. Once linked, the bot saves this information so any redemption in anyone's chat will be saved, and processed automatically.

### Updating your Minecraft username

Type `!link <username>` again and it will automatically update your username. Whitelists, and other items based off of UUID in game, will not be impacted upon name changes.
