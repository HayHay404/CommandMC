# Linking, Updating & Unlinking

Only premium Minecraft accounts are permitted to be used with CommandMC. We do not support "cracked" or "offline" accounts.
{% endhint %}

### Linking your Minecraft username

To link your Minecraft account to your Twitch account, simply type `!link <username>` in any Twitch chat where this bot has been added. Once linked, the bot saves this information so any redemption in anyone's chat will be saved, and processed automatically.

**You will NOT have to repeat this again unless your username changes.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Updating your Minecraft username

Type `!link <username>` again and it will automatically update your username. Whitelists, and other items based off of UUID in game, will not be impacted upon name changes.
