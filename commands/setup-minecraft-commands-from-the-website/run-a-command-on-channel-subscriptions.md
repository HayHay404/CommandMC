# Run a command on channel subscriptions

Creating a custom reward on subscription is pretty similar to the [channel point reward](run-a-command-on-channel-point-redemption.md) process.

To enable the custom reward for Subscriptions, simply toggle it on and fill out the form.

The difference between channel point reward and subscription, is you have to specify a command to run on the end of subscription. In this scenario, an example could be `whitelist remove $user` on subscription end.

After pressing `Submit`, if the reward is present in the page you're redirected to then it has been successfully created. Enjoy!
