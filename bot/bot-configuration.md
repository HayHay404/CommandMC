# Bot Configuration

Once you've [configured your Minecraft server](server-configuration.md), you're ready to edit the bot's config on the [website](https://commandmc.hayhay.dev).&#x20;

Upon pressing "Sign in with Twitch", you'll be redirected to a page to invite the bot to your channel. Upon accepting, you'll be once again redirected to a panel to set your server configuration.

Enter your server configuration based on the steps you followed previously, including the RCON Port and Server password you created in the last step.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your password cannot be empty or "password." Please use something strong for security purposes.
{% endhint %}

After you've submitted, the page will reload and the password field will appear empty again. This is expected behavior.&#x20;

You can now go on to setting up your custom rewards.
